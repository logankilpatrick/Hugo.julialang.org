Matrix Depot is a Julia software package that provides
easy access to a large and diverse collection of
test matrices. Its novelty is threefold. First, it
is extensible by the user, and so can be adapted to
include the userâ€™s own test problems. In doing so it
facilitates experimentation and makes it easier to
carry out reproducible research. Second, it
amalgamates in a single framework three different
types of matrix collections, comprising parametrized
test matrices, regularization test problems, and
real-life sparse matrix data. Third, it fully
exploits the Julia language. It uses multiple
dispatch to help provide a simple interface and, in
particular, to allow matrices to be generated in any
of the numeric data types supported by the language.
