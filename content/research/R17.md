We performed computational screening of effective diffusivity in different configurations of cubes and cuboids compared with spheres and ellipsoids. In total, more than 1500 structures are generated and screened for effective diffusivity. We studied simple cubic and face-centered cubic lattices of spheres and cubes, random configurations of cubes and spheres as a function of volume fraction and polydispersity, and finally random configurations of ellipsoids and cuboids as a function of shape. We found some interesting shape-dependent differences in behavior, elucidating the impact of shape on the targeted design of granular materials.
