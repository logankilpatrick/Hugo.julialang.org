We present the results of a friendly competition for formal verification of continuous and hybrid systems with nonlinear 
continuous dynamics. The friendly competition took place as part of the workshop Applied Verification for Continuous and 
Hybrid Systems (ARCH) in 2019. In this year, 6 tools Ariadne, CORA, DynIbex, Flow*, Isabelle/HOL, and JuliaReach 
(in alphabetic order) participated. They are applied to solve reachability analysis problems on four benchmark problems, 
one of them with hybrid dynamics. We do not rank the tools based on the results, but show the current status and discover 
the potential advantages of different tools.
