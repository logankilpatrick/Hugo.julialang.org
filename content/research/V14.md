This master's thesis explores the possibility to provide
access to the computing power of a GPU from the high-level programming
language Julia. An important requirement here is to keep the
programmer's productivity at the same high level as if he would use
Julia without a GPU. Indeed, very specialized and detailed technical
knowledge is needed in order to program a GPU, making it complex
and time-consuming. In many modern scientific domains quite a lot of
brute computing power is required, but often these domains lack the
technical expertise to use GPUs in an efficient manner.

The purpose of this thesis is to provide access to a GPU from Julia
in a way that shields the GPU details from the programmer. In a first
step we define and implement in Julia abstractions that can be executed
in parallel on the GPU. Next we adapt the Julia compiler such
that it can translate these abstractions to GPU code. The resulting
compiler infrastructure manages the GPU in a way that is transparent
to the programmer. Finally we evaluate the abstractions and compiler
infrastructure in the context of a concrete application, namely
the trace transform.
