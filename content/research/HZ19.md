Directional variograms were introduced in geostatistics as a tool for revealing major
directions of correlation in spatial data. However, their estimation presents some
practical challenges, particularly in the case of large irregularly-sampled data sets
where efficient spectral-based estimation methods are not applicable. In this work,
we propose a generalization of directional variograms to general partitions of spatial
data, and introduce a parallel estimation algorithm that can efficiently handle large
data sets with more than 10^5 points. This partition variogram generalization is motivated
by a five-spot point pattern in the petroleum industry, which we named more generally as
the isolated-lines arrangement. In such an arrangement, traditional estimators of directional
variograms such as -tube estimators very often fail to incorporate measurements from adjacent
lines (e.g. vertical wells) without also incorporating measurements from other planes (e.g.
horizontal layers). We provide illustrations of this new concept, and assess the approximation
error of the proposed estimators with bootstrap methods and synthetic Gaussian process data.
