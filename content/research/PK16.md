Rapid pace of innovation in industrial research labs
requires fast algorithm evaluation cycles. The use of multi-core
hardware and distributed clusters is essential to achieve reasonable
turnaround times for high-load simulations. Juliaâ€™s support for these
as well as its pervasive multiple dispatch make it very attractive for
high-performance technical computing.

Our experiments in speeding up a Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
Intellectual Property (IP) model simulation for a Wireless LAN (WLAN)
product confirm this. We augment standard SystemC High-Level Synthesis
(HLS) tool-flow by an interactive worksheet supporting performance
visualization and rapid design space exploration cycles.
