POMDPs.jl is an open-source framework for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially
observable MDPs (POMDPs). POMDPs.jl allows users to specify sequential decision making problems with minimal
effort without sacrificing the expressive nature of POMDPs, making this framework viable for both
educational and research purposes. It is written in the Julia language to allow flexible prototyping and
large-scale computation that leverages the high-performance nature of the language. The associated
JuliaPOMDP community also provides a number of state-of-the-art MDP and POMDP solvers and a rich library of
support tools to help with implementing new solvers and evaluating the solution results. The most recent version of
POMDPs.jl, the related packages, and documentation can be found at github.com/JuliaPOMDP/POMDPs.jl.
