Scientific algorithms are designed and implemented in a variety of programming
languages. Depending on the exact application, some languages are a better
choice than others: some offer a productive environment while others focus on
performance. Selecting a language is often difficult, with poor choices
resulting in much higher development times.

By implementing a case study algorithm in multiple programming languages, we
compare their pros and cons. As a case study, we selected the trace transform,
an image processing algorithm from the widely used class of integral transforms.
We describe each implementation, including a highly optimized version for NVIDIA
graphics processing units, and present a productivity overview and an in-depth
performance analysis, from which we draw more generic conclusions.

We have found that MATLAB is still the best choice overall, but Julia proves an
interesting emerging choice. For realistic images, our CUDA implementation
offers the best performance, albeit at a high development cost.
