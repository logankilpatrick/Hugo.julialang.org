We describe a package realized in the Julia programming
language which performs symbolic manipulations applied to nonlinear
evolution equations, their flows, and commutators of such objects. This
tool was employed to perform contrived computations arising in the analysis
of the local error of operator splitting methods. It enabled the proof
of the convergence of the basic method and of the asymptotical correctness
of a defect-based error estimator. The performance of our package
is illustrated on several examples.
