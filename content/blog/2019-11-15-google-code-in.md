title: The Julia Language participates in Google's Code-In Contest
---

We are pleased to announce that The Julia Language has been accepted to participate in the Google Code-In program. This is a contest for 13-17 year olds, introducing them to the world of open source development.

The program involves lots of small, bite-sized tasks. During the contest, students will claim and then subsequently complete tasks to win prizes (and learn of course). Tasks can be in the areas of coding, design, QA, documentation or outreach.

We think this is a great opportunity for us to pay back for the amazing things that high school students have achieved for our community; as well as to pay it forward for a new crop of young contributors. With that said, we need your help spreading the word about this program. This is not only an opportunity for us to get more people exposed to the Julia Programming Language but more importantly, it is an opportunity to expose students to the wonders of open source and software. 

If you know teachers, parents, or students who may be interested, send them over to [https://codein.withgoogle.com](https://codein.withgoogle.com). The contest runs December 2nd through January 23rd and we want to get as many students involved as possible. 

We are also still looking for experienced Julia developers to mentor students throughout the contest period. If you are interested in mentoring students, please get in touch with Avik Sengupta, Dhairya Gandhi, or Logan Kilpatrick via Slack, Email, or elsewhere.
